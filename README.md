# mqtt-siren
12V 6-sound Action siren (VERY loud and VERY annoying) hooked up to MQTT

Arduino code for NodeMCU.


Simple schematic of the siren: http://i.imgur.com/wr5XCI7.jpg?1 (without amplifier). Hook up the IC inputs to the NodeMCU pins directly. Make sure to remove the buttons, and combine the two ground connections.
